An enhanced farming mod with spreding crops which wilt if not harvested.
The crops are roughly parted into diggable and punchable fruits. Diggable fruits give harvest by digging, where you have to craft the seeds out of the harvest.
Punchable fruits give you one harvest by punching and regrow the fruit.
If waited too long, the fruits are wilt, degrading into time without any harvest, so be in time.
Fruits can be infected and spreading the infections to other crops nearby with the possibility to heal the crops with kind of medicine.
