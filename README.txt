Minetest Game mod: farming
==========================
See license.txt for license information.

Mod for extending the farming capabilities of minetest. 
You have wild crops, which you can cultivate to get faster and more harvest.
The crops can be infected, where you get nothing. And the infection spreads to nearby crops.
A culture of crops can be destroyed by the infection, where the cultured variant of crops 
are easier infected than the wild form.
With special plants you can make a curing mixture. And other plants can protect the culture.
